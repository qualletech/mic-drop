# Mic Drop

Hi NYC comedy friends! This is the codebase for mic drop. We're trying to make open mics in the city more accessible
with this centralized dashboard.

## Development Resources

This dashboard is built using Next.js and TypeScript.

## Contributions

We currently do not accept contributions, but this will change in the future!

## Forking guidelines

Feel free to fork this codebase and play around with it! However, it's very important to be clear to users when you're
giving them a fork.

Please be sure to:

- Change all branding in the repository and UI to clearly differentiate from Mic Drop.
- Change any support links (feedback, email, terms of service, etc) to your own systems.
- Replace any analytics or error-collection systems.
